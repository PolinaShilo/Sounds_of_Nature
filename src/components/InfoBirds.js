<h2>titmouse, also called tit, plural titmice, small cheery-voiced nonmigratory woodland bird. Along with the chickadees, titmice make up the family Paridae (order Passeriformes), with approximately 55 species throughout the world, mostly in the Northern Hemisphere.

Bold and athletic, the titmice are among the best-loved visitors to bird feeders. Although they range in size from 11.5 to 20 cm (4.5 to 8 inches), most fall in the middle of this range (17 cm [6.5 inches]). Despite their small size, they are extremely athletic and hardy. Many live in the far north and are able to endure bitterly cold winters, in part thanks to their strategy of storing food in bark crevices or holes and remembering the locations for later retrieval. Special leg muscles enable them to hang upside down to feed, allowing them to feast on items such as insect eggs that might be missed by less-agile birds.</h2>
